We built this tool because we were tired of "free" tools that force you to create an account just to copy a text snippet.

**PromptRule** is a completely free prompt generator. No sign up. No login. No credit limits.

## The Problem
Most prompt generators fall into two categories:
1.  **The Paywall Trap**: They look free, but ask for your email after 3 tries.
2.  **The "Lazy" Generator**: You type "write a blog," and they just expand it to "please write a blog."

## Our Solution: Decisions Over Suggestions
We don't just rephrase your words. We structure them.

When you use [PromptRule](https://promptrule.com), we wrap your raw idea into a production-ready framework containing:
-   **Role**: Assigning a specific expert persona.
-   **Workflow**: Step-by-step logic for the AI to follow.
-   **Constraints**: Strict negative rules (e.g., "no jargon", "JSON only").

### Comparison
| Feature | Others | PromptRule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Required** | Yes (usually) | **No** |
| **Cost** | Freemium | **100% Free** |
| **Style** | Vague suggestions | **Strict structure** |

## How to use
There is no installation or API key required. It runs entirely in the browser.

1.  Go to **[https://promptrule.com](https://promptrule.com)**
2.  Type your idea (e.g., "Python script to scrape data" or "Cyberpunk city image")
3.  Click **Generate**
4.  Copy the structured prompt

It works optimized for **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Midjourney**, and **Stable Diffusion**.

## Example Data
