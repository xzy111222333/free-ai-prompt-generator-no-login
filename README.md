# Free AI Prompt Generator (No Sign Up)

This repository hosts the documentation and examples for **[PromptRule.com](https://promptrule.com)**.

We built this tool because we were tired of "free" tools that force you to create an account just to copy a text snippet.

**PromptRule** is a completely free prompt generator. No sign up. No login. No credit limits.

## The Problem
Most prompt generators fall into two categories:
1.  **The Paywall Trap**: They look free, but ask for your email after 3 tries.
2.  **The "Lazy" Generator**: You type "write a blog," and they just expand it to "please write a blog."

## Our Solution: Decisions Over Suggestions
We don't just rephrase your words. We structure them.

When you use [PromptRule](https://promptrule.com), we wrap your raw idea into a production-ready framework containing:
-   **Role**: Assigning a specific expert persona.
-   **Workflow**: Step-by-step logic for the AI to follow.
-   **Constraints**: Strict negative rules (e.g., "no jargon", "JSON only").

### Comparison
| Feature | Others | PromptRule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Required** | Yes (usually) | **No** |
| **Cost** | Freemium | **100% Free** |
| **Style** | Vague suggestions | **Strict structure** |

## How to use
There is no installation or API key required. It runs entirely in the browser.

1.  Go to **[https://promptrule.com](https://promptrule.com)**
2.  Type your idea (e.g., "Python script to scrape data" or "Cyberpunk city image")
3.  Click **Generate**
4.  Copy the structured prompt

It works optimized for **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Midjourney**, and **Stable Diffusion**.

## Example Data
In this repository, you will find `examples.json`. This file contains a list of structured prompts generated by our engine, which you can use freely in your own projects or testing.

## Why is it free?
The site is supported by standard Google Ads. This allows us to keep the tool open, unlimited, and free without needing to sell your data or force you to log in.
